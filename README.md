# Maze-Master-VR
This game is my capstone project. It's currently in the middle to where the asset design is finished. All that's remaining is to filter in the story as well as more of the environment. I'll be working on it to implement story and a few more assets.

I did switch to a different rendering pipeline so if anything is error-pink, it just hasn't been set to the correct shader.
